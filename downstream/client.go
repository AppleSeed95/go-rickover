// A client for a downstream HTTP service that can do work.
//
// Once the dequeuer takes jobs out of the database, it needs to do some work
// and then report whether the work was successful or not. We do this by making
// a HTTP request to a downstream service that doesn't have any state built in,
// it just performs work when it's told to do so.
//
// This package contains a client for making requests to that downstream
// service. For example usage, check the example in this file or JobProcessor
// in the services package.
