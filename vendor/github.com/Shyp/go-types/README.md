# go-types

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Shyp/go-types.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Shyp/go-types)

This is a library of types that are useful for dealing with JSON API's, and/or
database fields. Currently supports `NullString` and `NullTime`, both of which
can be serialized to/from JSON or a database.
